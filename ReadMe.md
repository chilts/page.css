# PageCSS #

Beautiful CSS for single page sites - a myriad of options and components.

## Why? ##

There are lots of CSS frameworks already out there, but I wanted something a bit simpler. To use most of those CSS
frameworks, you have to dig to find what classes to put onto each of your elements. Add this class here, add that class
there.

PageCSS works differently.

Just add a `pagecss` class to either your `<body>` element, or any other top level element such as `<div>` or
`<article>` and voila, your regular, ordinary, plain, HTML is now styled to make the page much nicer.

Essentially, is it a nicer page for regular HTML.
